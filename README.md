# shortest-path-Country-tour
first version

Introduction
In this project, we want to calculate optimum path (shortest) for a IRAN Tour among different alternative
possible paths defined as follows:
This Tour begins from starting point Urmia city (north west of Iran – green point on map) and will finish in
Chabahar city (South east of Iran – green point on map) The map and different paths are connecting cities
(vertices) as a sequence of edges. Graph, in which every city is a vertex, and distance (km with car) of each
two cities are shown as edges. Thus: The shortest path will be selected based on distance
Distance: between two cities that is measured with km Reference: google maps
Thus, every edge has 4 features ; < index, fromnode , tonode, distance>
